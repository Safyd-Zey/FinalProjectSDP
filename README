## Project Description

The Online Course Platform is a Java-based application designed to efficiently provide a variety of courses for students. It includes features such as course purchasing (e.g., Calculus, Web Development, Python), a convenient payment system, and the flexibility to choose the course format. The platform caters to both teachers and students, allowing teachers to add students, send welcome messages, and providing the ability to download course descriptions in both txt and html formats. Throughout the development, the team prioritized user convenience for students, parents, and teachers.

## Design Patterns

### Singleton Pattern

In our project, the Singleton pattern is applied to the `UserManager` class, ensuring a singular instance for centralized user management. This design choice establishes a global point for user-related operations, promoting efficiency by preventing unnecessary object instantiation.

### Strategy Patern

Strategy Design Pattern is used to select delivery methods. This construct includes an abstract class that defines the general delivery method and classes that dynamically control the delivery strategy. Specific implementations encapsulate specific delivery methods, allowing users to select and apply different delivery strategies during the product purchasing process.

###Adapter pattern

The adapter pattern resolves the interface mismatch between Barcode and Product. The OldBarcodeAdapter class acts as an intermediary, adapting the Product interface to the Barcode interface, facilitating integration into the broader structure of the online course platform application.

###Decorator Pattern

Decorator Design Pattern is used to add a discount system. We have an abstract class Discounts, which contains the logic of specific classes. Discounts: holiday, preferential, for regular customers. You can add discounts and they add up


### Factory pattern

The Factory pattern is used to facilitate the dynamic creation of various products. Specific factories, Laptop(), Phone(), create instances of the corresponding products. This modular and expandable design allows the addition of new products and their corresponding factories.

### Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is used to provide a connection between Observers and observed changes. This pattern allows for a loosely coupled design where the platform can receive notifications without explicit knowledge of their individual details.
